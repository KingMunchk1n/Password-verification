The "PasswordChecker" class is a handy tool to help you make sure your password is strong and secure. It checks things like length, whether there are numbers and letters in different cases, and special characters, so you know your password meets the minimum requirements. The list of mistakes it finds will help you improve your password and protect your account and personal information even more.
